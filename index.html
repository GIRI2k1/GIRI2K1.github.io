HAYABUSA  STEPS MARKET DOORS</h2>
<p style="font-size:22px">
The Hayabusa’s 1340cc inline-four banging off its 8000-rpm launch control setting was enough to intimidate anyone, especially a couple of cars. Or so I thought; after all, both the Merc and the Audi have their own tricks up their German sleeves. The A 45 S, as I discovered on a high-speed track last month, is an accomplished speedster, with the world’s most powerful production inline-four motor rated at 421 bhp. The Audi, on the other hand, produces 408 planet-friendly horses and 68 kgm of efficient twisting force from standstill. The AMG’s 57 kgm and the ’Busa’s 15 kgm suddenly looked rather uncomfortable. And all of this while the Suzuki had only one wheel to put power down with, while the Germans gained the obvious advantages of their 4Matic+ and quattro all-wheel-drive systems.

<h3 style="font-size:28px">KAWASKI H2R</h3>
<h4 style="font-size:28px">BEAST WITHIN THE STOCK</h4>
<p style="font-size:22px">
The Kawasaki Ninja H2R is a track-only motorcycle, laden with carbon fiber bodywork and a free-flow titanium exhaust.

Under the skin, the H2R uses a supercharged 999cc, inline-four engine putting out nearly 330 horsepower and 122 pound-feet. Now, this is more than enough to launch you skywards in an instant, so Kawasaki has equipped the bike with top-spec electronics, an Ohlins steering damper, and aerodynamic winglets to help with downforce.

The latest of the Ninja H2 R speedfreaks comes to us all the way from New Zealand. Scott Wilkins, from Tauranga, a coastal city in New Zealand, recently set a record-breaking speed on Goudies Road near Reporoa. His ultimate record was at 364.5 kilometers per hour—that’s 226.5 miles per hour—on a one-way run. Since speed records are recorded in two-way stints, his final record was 358.4 kilometers per hour, or 222.7 miles per hour.
<br>His second goal was nowhere near as spectacular but you can bet it gave him just as much satisfaction. I enjoyed scoring from three yards just as much as I did from 30.</p>

The fact that it’s not a road bike also ensures that the superbike is a ‘rider’ only bike. Kawasaki states that the bike can carry only 110 Kg. So if you’re well built and are equipped with a helmet, tracksuit, and other gears and have had a healthy meal, the rider alone is enough to exceed the weight capacity. Naturally, there is no pillion seat.

While riding, you will be overwhelmed with the experience, but that doesn’t hamper the comfort. Indeed, you cannot use it for an extended cruise because it’s not legal, but you can enjoy multiple track rounds before the aggressive stance feels exhausting.  

The Ninja H2R offers adequate comfort due to the ergonomically enhanced seat design. The rider’s seat height is measured at 830 mm, making the rider’s position reasonably aggressive and well-suited based on the bike’s specifications.

The suspensions of the bike are a perfect fit to complement over 300 horse-power of the superbike. With the rear featuring the new Uni-Trak, Öhlins TTX36 gas-charged shock matted with a piggyback reservoir combined with the inverted fork, including rebound and compression damping in the front, the ride feels wild but smooth!
